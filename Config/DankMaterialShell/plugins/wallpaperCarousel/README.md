# Wallpaper Carousel

Based on the original wallpaper picker by [ilyamiro](https://github.com/ilyamiro/nixos-configuration).

A [DankMaterialShell](https://danklinux.com/) plugin that lets you browse and pick wallpapers from a fullscreen skewed carousel overlay.

## About

Wallpaper Carousel scans your current wallpaper directory and displays all images in an animated 3D-skewed carousel. Navigate with keyboard or mouse, press Enter to apply. Thumbnails are pre-cached in memory at boot for instant opening.

This plugin integrates with all DMS features — selecting a wallpaper updates the shell wallpaper, color scheme, and any other DMS components that react to wallpaper changes.

## Install

> **Note:** DankMaterialShell must be managing your wallpaper for this plugin to work. It does not work with external wallpaper engines (e.g. swww, swaybg, hyprpaper). Enable wallpaper management in DMS Settings → Wallpaper.

1. Download the latest archive from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Extract it into your DMS plugins directory:
   ```sh
   tar xf wallpaperCarousel-*.tar.gz -C "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/DankMaterialShell/plugins/"
   ```
3. Open DankMaterialShell Settings → Plugins and enable **Wallpaper Carousel**
4. Bind keys in your compositor config (see below) or call the IPC commands from a script

## IPC Commands

Control the carousel via DMS IPC:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `dms ipc wallpaperCarousel toggle` | Open or close the overlay |
| `dms ipc wallpaperCarousel open` | Open the overlay |
| `dms ipc wallpaperCarousel close` | Close the overlay |
| `dms ipc wallpaperCarousel cycleNext` | Open (if closed) and highlight next wallpaper |
| `dms ipc wallpaperCarousel cyclePrevious` | Open (if closed) and highlight previous wallpaper |

**Keyboard shortcuts** (when open): `←` / `→` to navigate, `Enter` to apply, `Escape` to close.
